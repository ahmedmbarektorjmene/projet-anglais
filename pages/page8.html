        <h2 style="color: #3706a8; margin-top: 0;">Why this course is technically important</h2>
        
        <p>Most courses only teach you how to write code in a notebook. The <strong>Machine Learning Zoomcamp</strong> is different because it teaches you how to build a complete system.</p>
        
        <ul style="padding-left: 20px; color: #e3e0e6;">
            <li><strong>Production Skills:</strong> You learn how to take a model and put it on a real server so people can use it.</li>
            <li><strong>Modern Tools:</strong> You will practice with professional technology like <strong>Docker, Kubernetes, and Cloud</strong> platforms.</li>
            <li><strong>Data Engineering:</strong> You learn how to clean and prepare large amounts of data, which is 80% of a real ML job.</li>
            <li><strong>Real Portfolio:</strong> By the end, you will have projects that look exactly like the work done in big tech companies.</li>
        </ul>
